# Microsoft-Classifying-Cybersecurity-Incidents-with-Machine-Learning

## üìÇ Project Overview

This project aims to assist Security Operations Centers (SOCs) by developing a machine learning model to predict triage grades for cybersecurity incidents. The model classifies incidents into **True Positive (TP)**, **Benign Positive (BP)**, and **False Positive (FP)** categories using the **GUIDE** dataset from Microsoft. The model helps SOC analysts make quicker, data-driven decisions, improving threat detection and response times.

## üéØ Project Scope

Our machine learning pipeline consists of:

1. **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**: Conduct exploratory analysis, handle missing data, and apply feature engineering.
2. **Model Development**: Build classification models, starting with baselines and advancing to models like Random Forest and XGBoost.
3. **Evaluation & Interpretation**: Assess performance using metrics like **Accuracy**, **Macro-F1 score**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and the **Confusion Matrix**.

## üß† Problem Statement

The project seeks to automate the triage process by building a model that accurately classifies cybersecurity incidents, aiming to reduce false positives and ensure that critical threats are prioritized.

---

## üí° Dataset Overview

The dataset contains more than 9.5 million rows, divided into **70% training** and **30% test data**. The data is structured into **three levels**: 

1. **Evidence Level** (IP, email, user info),
2. **Alert Level** (potential incidents), and 
3. **Incident Level** (comprehensive threats).

## üìä Metrics

We evaluate the model using the following metrics:

- **Accuracy**: Measures overall correctness.
- **Macro-F1 Score**: Balances performance across all classes.
- **Precision**: Evaluates correct positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Measures the ability to capture relevant positive cases.
- **Confusion Matrix**: Visualizes classification performance.

## üõ°Ô∏è Business Use Cases

- **SOCs**: Automate incident triage for faster, data-driven responses.
- **Incident Response Automation**: Suggest actions based on classification.
- **Threat Intelligence**: Enhance detection accuracy using historical data.
- **Enterprise Security**: Improve response to true threats while reducing false positives.

## üõ†Ô∏è Approach

### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
- **EDA**: Investigated feature distributions, target class balance, and correlations.
- **Missing Data Handling**: Applied imputation, removal, and model-based techniques.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created new features, such as timestamps, and encoded categorical variables.
  
### 2. Model Selection and Training
- **Baseline Models**: Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers provided a performance benchmark.
- **Advanced Models**: Random Forest and XGBoost were explored for improved accuracy, although the tuned Decision Tree outperformed them.
  
### 3. Model Evaluation and Tuning
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluated using accuracy, macro-F1, precision, and recall. Decision Tree showed the best results.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Applied grid search to optimize model performance, with the tuned Decision Tree offering slight improvements.
